# John's Pizza Project 

In order to view the project:

  - Clone the repo
  - npm install
  - npm start
  - view in browser

There was an issue with CORS and getting the API endpoints locally in my chrome browser. I didn't feel the need to start messing with my browser for a small project, so if you experience the same, then please view in Firefox.
